Write a python program that takes a string as an input from the user and 
checks if there are any groups of THREE consecutive vowels. The input 
string will be a random combination of small letter and capital letter 
characters. Then replace all the three consecutive vowels with “#” 
character. So, the presence of such a group is ensured.
=========================================================

Sample Input1:
FJAUjsioAstu

Sample Output 1
FJAUjs###stu

Explanation 1:
Since ‘i’, ’o’ and ‘A’ are three vowels and they appear in the input string 
consecutively. So all those three characters are replaced by ‘#’ character 
in the output.
=========================================================
Sample Input2:
asoUiBPqteeastW

Sample Output 2
as###BPqt###stW

Explanation 2:
Here, ‘o’, ‘U’ and ‘i’ form a group of three consecutive vowels and again 
‘e’, ’e’, and ‘a’ form another such group. So all of them are replaced by 
‘#’ character. But the single ‘a’ at the very beginning is not replaced 
since it is not included in any group of three.
