Suppose you are building an isosceles right angle pyramid using a number of 
bricks given by the user. After building the pyramid you will have to 
return the unused brick to the user.
Write a python program to solve this problem. (“#” representing brick)
[Hint: 1+2+3+...+n = User input - Remaining bricks]

=============================================================
Sample Input 1:
15
Output 1:
#
##
###
####
#####
Remaining bricks: 0
=============================================================
Sample Input 2:
35
Output 2:
#
##

Remaining bricks: 7
=============================================================
Sample Input 3:
26
Output 3:
#
##
###

#####
######
Remaining bricks: 5

Write a python program that takes a string with multiple numbers separated 
by commas as an input. The string contains experimental length values in 
repeated experiments. Make a list from the string. Then sorts the list and 
only keeps the readings that have a maximum difference of 20 between 
successive elements in the sorted list and removes other elements from the 
list. Finally, it calculates the average of the remaining list items and 
prints the average. [You can use builtin .sort() function to sort the list]
  ====================================================
Sample Input 1:
90, 50, 30, 15, 10, 5

Sample Output 1:
Sorted list: [5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 90]
Criteria pass: [5, 10, 15, 30, 50]
Average: 22.0

Explanation 1:
First sort the list in ascending order – [5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 90].
The difference between 5 and 10 is 5. So 5 and 10 are kept on the list.
The difference between 10 and 15 is 5. So 15 is kept in the list.
The difference between 15 and 30 is 15 which is less than 20 so kept in the 
list.
The difference between 30 and 50 is 20 which is equal to 20 so kept in the 
list.
The difference between 50 and 90 is 50 which is greater than 20 so 90 is 
removed from the list.
Thus remaining sorted list – [5, 10, 15, 30, 50] and the average is 22
==========================================================
Sample Input 2 :
33, 180, 40, 50, 6

Sample Output 2:
Sorted list: [6, 33, 40, 50, 180]
Criteria pass: [33, 40, 50]
Average: 41.0
