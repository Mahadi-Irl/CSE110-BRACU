Write a Python function that will take a list of integer values as the 
parameter and transform those values using normalization. Finally, return 
the normalized list.

The formula of normalization for this task is given below:
new value = (current value - minimum of all values) / (maximum of all 
values - minimum of all values)

[You do not need to take the list as user input. But your program should 
work for any list of integers passed as the parameter. Additionally, you 
can not use the built-in max() and min() functions to find the maximum and 
minimum of all values respectively.]

Function Call 1:
normalize([10, 4, 23, 49, 36])

Sample Output 1:
[0.13333333333333333, 0.0, 0.4222222222222222, 1.0, 0.7111111111111111]

Explanation: In the given list, the maximum value is 49 and the minimum 
value is 4. If we apply the above formula for each value in the given list, 
we will get the desired output list.

Function Call 2:
normalize([6, 67, 21, 37, 54])

Sample Output 2:
[0.0, 1.0, 0.2459016393442623, 0.5081967213114754, 0.7868852459016393]

Explanation: In the given list, the maximum value is 67 and the minimum 
value is 6. If we apply the above formula for each value in the given list, 
we will get the desired output list.
