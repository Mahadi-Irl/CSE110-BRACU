Write a Python program that takes an integer Y from 10 to 20 inclusive as 
an input from the user and prints “The user entered Y”. Then the program 
should print a series of numbers, starting at Y as the first term of the 
series and then the following terms will be according to the formula Y = (2 
x Y) - 5 until Y is less than 100. If the user enters an integer that is 
beyond the range mentioned above, your program should print “Wrong input”.

====================================================
Sample Input 1:
10
Sample Output 1:
The user entered 10
10, 15, 25, 45, 85

Explanation 1:
The user gave 10 as input so “The user entered 10” is printed. Then the 
series starts from 10 and the next number is 2*10 - 5 = 15, the next one 
2*15 - 5 = 25 and so on up to 85 because the next number in sequence 2*85 - 
5 = 165 is greater than 100.

====================================================
Sample Input 2:
30

Sample Output 2:
The user entered 30
Wrong input

Explanation 2: The user gave 30 as input so “The user entered 30” is 
printed at first. However, since 30 is beyond the range of 10 to 20 
inclusive, this time our program prints “wrong input” instead of a sequence.

====================================================
Sample Input 3:
14

Sample Output 3:
The user entered 14
14, 23, 41, 77.

Explanation 3:
The user gave 14 as input this time so “The user entered 14” is printed. 
Then the series starts from 14 and the next number is 2*14 - 5 = 23, the 
next one 2*23 - 5 = 41 and so on up to 77 because the next number in 
sequence 2*77 - 5 = 149 is greater than 100.
