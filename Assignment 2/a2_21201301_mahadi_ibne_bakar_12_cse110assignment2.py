"""## Write the code in Python for following problems:

**<font color='red'>[Please follow variable naming conventions including using meaningful variable names for all the tasks]</font>**

### Task 1

Write python program, which prints the following sequences of values in loops:

a)	24, 18, 12, 6, 0, -6\
b)	-10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20\
c)	18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63\
d)	18, -27, 36, -45, 54, -63

=====================================================================

**Hints(1):** Use a while loop for solving these problems.

**Hints(2):** We are already familiar with the print() function. But when we use it to print any value it automatically adds an additional newline after each print statement.

For example:\
print(1)\
print(2)

Output:\
1\
2

=====================================================================

To solve this problem, in Python3, we can add an extra argument (end = " ") in the print function which tells the program to skip printing the additional newline.

For example:\
print(1, end =" ")\
print(2)

Output: (prints the next output right to the previous one)\
12

=====================================================================

In Task-1(a), the loop counter should be initialized at 24 and the loop should terminate when the loop counter reaches -6. The difference between the first two values is 24 - 18 = 6. So the loop counter value is getting decremented by 6 in every iteration.

For your understanding, task 1(a) code is done for you.

### Task 11
Write a Python program which takes a number and prints the digits from the unit place, then the tenth, then hundredth, etc. <font color='red'>(Right to Left)</font>

**Example:** If the user gives 32768, then print 8, 6, 7, 2, 3 

=========================================================================

**Hint (1):**  The input() function, converts the input data to String data type by default. Therefore, please type cast it to an integer before proceeding further.


**Hint  (2):** First to get the digit from the right side, we can take the remainder of the number using modulus (%) operator i.e. mod 10 to get the rightmost digit and print it. For dropping the last digit, we can perform floor division by 10 on the number and then continue the same to print the other digits as shown below.

32768 % 10 = 8 

32768 // 10 = 3276 

Then,

3276 % 10 = 6

3276 // 10 = 327 

and so on

327 % 10 = 7 

327 // 10 = 32 

32 % 10 = 2 

32 // 10 = 3 

3 % 10 = 3 

3 // 10 = 0 

Done! When the number becomes 0 you can end your loop.

**Example:** If the user gives 9876, your program should print 4.

then, 987 // 10 = 98, count = 2 \
98 // 10 = 9, count = 3 \

"""### Task 13
Write a Python program that takes a number from the user and prints its digits from  <font color='red'> left to right. </font>

<font color='red'>[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER. You are not allowed to use String indexing for solving this task]</font>

=========================================================================

**Example:** if the user gives 32768, then print 3, 2, 7, 6, 8 

=========================================================================

**Hint(1):**  The input() function takes the input data as String data type by default. Please convert it to an integer before starting your code for the task.

**Hint(2):**  

Step 1: First, count how many digits\
Step 2: Then, calculate 10 to the power (number of digits - 1).

Step 3 with explanation: Say, the input given by the user as in our example, 32768 has 5 digits, so calculating 10 to the power 4 gives us 10000. Then floor dividing 32768 by 10000, we can get 3.\
Proceeding further, the remainder of 32768 by 10000 (32768 % 10000) gives us 2768. This time to get 2 we need to floor divide 2768 by 1000 which is basically our 10000/10. Again, taking remainder of 2768 by 1000 gives us 768 which we then divide by 100 (i.e. 1000/10) and keep on doing this until there are no more digits left (zero).


**To summarize and clarify:**\
Loop 1: First, we count digits like our Task 12, say 5 in this case for 32768\
Loop 2: Then, we calculate 10 to the power 4 (5-1), that is 10000.\
Loop 3: Then we keep repeating the three steps of floor dividing, modulus and dividing by 10 as demonstrated below.

32768 // 10000 = 3\
32768 % 10000 = 2768 \
10000 // 10 = 1000

2768 // 1000 = 2\
2768 % 1000 = 768\
1000 // 10 = 100

768 // 100 = 7\
768 % 100 = 68 \
100 // 10 = 10

68 // 10 = 6\
68 % 10 = 8 \
10 // 10 = 1

8 // 1 = 8\
8 % 1 = 0 \
1 // 10 = 0

Done. Loop ends as number has become 0.

"""### Task 22

Write a python program that converts a Decimal Integer number to a Binary Number. 

**A decimal can be converted to a binary number by keeping track of the remainders after each division of that number by 2. **

==========================================================

**Example 01:**

For example, to convert 11 to a binary number, we can try the following approach.

11/2 = 5 (Remainder 1) 
<br>5/2 = 2 (Remainder 1) 
<br>2/2 = 1 (Remainder 0) 
<br>1/2 = 0 (Remainder 1) 

Now, taking the remainders from bottom to top gives us the binary number which is 1011. Binary of 11 is 1011.

**Sample Input:** <br>
11

**Sample Output:**<br>
1011

==========================================================

**Example 02:**

Similarly, to convert 13 to a binary number:

13/2 = 6 (Remainder 1) 
<br>6/2 = 3 (Remainder 0) 
<br>3/2 = 1 (Remainder 1) 
<br>1/2 = 0 (Remainder 1) 

Again, taking the remainders from the bottom to top, which is 1101 gives us the binary number. Binary of 13 is 1101.

**Sample Input:** <br>
13

**Sample Output:**<br>
1101

# take input from user

# set initial value for variables

counter = 0

# set conditions

while True :
    x = num % 2

    z = z + x * 10 ** counter

# end

"""### Task 23

Write a python program that converts a Binary number to a Decimal Integer Number after taking the binary number as an input from the user. 

**A binary number can be converted to its corresponding decimal number by multiplying each binary digit with a power of 2 where the power denotes the position of the binary digit**

==========================================================

**Example 01:**

For example, to convert 1010 to decimal, we can do this


$2^{3}$ x 1 + $2^{2}$ x 0 + $2^{1}$ x 1 + $2^{0}$ x 0 = 10


**Sample Input:** <br>
1010

**Sample Output:** <br>
10

==========================================================

**Example 02:**

So, to convert 11101, we can do this


$2^{4}$ x 1 + $2^{3}$ x 1 + $2^{2}$ x 1 + $2^{1}$ x 0 + $2^{0}$ x 1 = 29


**Sample Input:** <br>
11101

**Sample Output:** <br>
29

"""### Task 24
Write a Python program that asks the user for a range (a starting number and an ending number) and then 
**counts** how many numbers are prime numbers and how many numbers are perfect numbers between that range. It also **prints** those numbers in the format shown in the output of the example given below. 


=========================================================================

**Hint (1):** We may declare two strings/lists to store the prime and perfect numbers. Inside the loop, we check for prime and perfect numbers and add them to respective string/list besides counting them.

**Hint (2):** We may need to convert numbers in String to integers for checking and calculations. We may again need to convert numbers to Strings for storing and printing as the outputs shown in the example below.

=========================================================================

**Example:** If the user gives us a range of between 2 and 6, there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) and 1 perfect number (6) in that range. 

**Input:**\
2\
6

**Output:**\
Between 2 and 6,\
Found 3 prime numbers \
Found 1 perfect number\
Prime numbers: 2,  3,  5 \
Perfect number: 6
